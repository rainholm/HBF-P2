Hail, and well-met!
 
Welcome to HelbreathUSA 3.8  

If you are a new player please 
check out the information on 
character development on the 
HelbreathUSA website.
 
Do not share accounts.  There is 
no reason for anyone to need a 
screenshot of an item you have.  
If you are going to do a trade get 
assistance from our GMs or take 
screenshots of the trade window.  
When you get something good or 
change gear go to a different map 
or log out and back in to save the 
character changes.  This will 
prevent any problems in event of a 
server crash.
 
Please keep in mind that you can 
despise the enemy townfolk but we 
do not permit real-world racism in 
this game.  Keep your language clean 
in public chat, please.
 
Enjoy the game, grow strong and kill 
many of the enemy!
 
GM1
