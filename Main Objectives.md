Not sure which way I'm going to take this, but a placeholder for a new HB server I will be creating something in the summer or fall of -18.

Objectives:
  1) Figure out which sources to start out with
    1.1) 2.20 vs. 2.24d vs. Helbreath Finland vs. Some other custom sources && MySQL vs. non-MySQL
    1.2) Find & compare the changelog of each version
    1.3) Scourge through the archive-HDD
  2) Make an outline of what kind of server it will be
    2.1) A low rate server, but should it be 180/200 or 320/600
    2.2) Should I enhance and fix the base game without adding anything extra or customize it?
      2.2.1) What kind of customizations can I do if I want to preserve the feel of the original game?
  3) Work on the server configs (items, spells, etc.) and re-balance them to be more in-line with the original game
      3.1) All known configs are somewhat customized, bugged or unbalanced - even the official ones
  4)
